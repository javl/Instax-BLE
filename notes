notepad used during reverse engineering


getting device info:
  use EventType.SUPPORT_FUNCTION_INFO
  as payload, use on of the following:
    InfoType.IMAGE_SUPPORT_INFO;    // 1
    InfoType.BATTERY_INFO;          // 2
    InfoType.PRINTER_FUNCTION_INFO; // 3
    InfoType.PRINT_HISTORY_INFO;    // 4
    InfoType.CAMERA_FUNCTION_INFO;  // 5
    InfoType.CAMERA_HISTORY_INFO;   // 6


on getting BATTERY_INFO in reply:
  response is four bytes <BBBB
  battery state? 0-7
  battery percentage? 0-100
  something (unused?)
  something (unused?)

  f = mVar.mo9878f()
  int i = f & 7;
  if i is NOT 2 or 3, throw LOW_POWER_ERROR

  it seems that if we're about to rpint and result == 1, we also throw this error (so you can use the camera to
    a certain extend with low power, but you're not allowed to print?)


this.photosLeft = (byte) (b & 15);
this.f5568b = Integer.valueOf((b >> 4) & 7);
this.isCharging = C1882e.f5764a.bitshiftAndCheckIfLargerThanZero(b, 7);
